But rarely in the history of Multiverse have Empires discovered how to breach the veil between worlds and colonise between universes and timelines. But like everything ever written down, all permutations are possible, and came an Empire which had yet to breach its own planet orbit but pierced through the fabric between universes, and began their own journey of colonialism in betwixt universes.</p>

An Empire that pierced the secrets of interuniversal travel in the wake of its great war, and began to spread among the different stories found in the Multiverse. Like room temperature bacteria, the Empire grows stronger and spreads further… but what point to an Empire? Like all things, there must be a reason for Imperialism, and empty platitudes provided by Empire-states will not be enough to explain their imperialistic tendencies. The Empire contradicts itselves with its Commonwealth nature, their claims of democracy clashing with outlander barbarism and slavery, their claims of evil rendered irrelevant by the actions of good from their citizens. The state is a contradiction, for an Empire is never a monolithic leviathan, and instead a series of individuals acting out their own lives amidst a convoluted political structure. Backstabs, hope, glory, tragedy, horrors, joy, romance, and a variety more are found in the Empire.

        <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify"}}>To be a sapient in such times is to be one amongst uncatalogued trillions. To be in a state trying to assert its own ability to live up to its ideals yet struggling every step in trying to do so. To either live by ink or to be condemned to death by it. There is no such thing as a simple day in the Empire, for at the peak of civilization, the only enemy all must face is themselves and their ideals.

Officially established on the 10th of December, 1038 ALB<span className="fnnum">.</span><span className="fncon">After Lunar Banishment</span>, the Empire was created via a treaty between the major world powers - The Royal Confederacy of MineLegotia, The Principality of Equestria, the United States of Manehatten, The Serene Federation of Lunar Equestria, The People's Republics and Collectives of North West Equestria, The Crystal Empire, The Federation of Changeling Republics, The Republic of Equestria, The Southern Confederacy of Equestrian States, The Republic of Threslesia, The Griffon Confederacy of States, The United Republics of Legotia; The United Republics of New Mareland, The United States of Hippogriffa, & The Kirin Unitary Republic. These states banded together to say 'never again' to the horrors of the Shattered War. The war where Pax Celestica finally ended in the flames of <strong>Burning Wednesday</strong>, a national crisis from which the once serene Principality shattered into pieces as weapons fell into the hooves and claws of radicals, ideologues, reformists, and all in between.

The Griffons went northwards to assist their Republican allies against the bugs. The Thestrals banded together in Central Equestria, surrounded by Revanchist Unicorn Armies, Rightist Communes, and a desperate Lunar Princess. Manehatten seceeded and declared for the end of the Principality permanently. Vanhoofer was seized by the followers of Larks and Bagel as their city was shelled by Crystallian Crusiers. And the Empire to the East, came in desperate, to try and stop the war that was wrecking their economy and secure themselves a proper supply of coal and crystals.

                      <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>When considering the universe, one must remember that in the logic of the Empire, that the universe of the Empire exists on, something that can be imagined as a 3D plane. These three axes determine the nature of the reality. There is the Alpha, Beta, and Delta axes. Of interest is the Beta Axis, in which could be best described as the 'seed' of a universe sort of like seeds in video games. Now, if one has a beta variable/seed of '48839SHDE', the variable next door of '48839SHF' would be almost similar, except for some minor modification. The larger the deviation, the more different the universe is. Interuniversal travel is often not possible due to the fact that there is an infinitely large distance between universes created by previous universes ceasing to exist due to fluctuations from higher Alpha layers. However, these infinite distances can be crossed as discovered by the Empire by using an anchor before creating the method of transportation. This can be done by, essentially taking something that represents as much of the material present within a given universe, like a book or data encrypted on a drive, and forcing it to jump into another universe using ludrcious amounts of energy. And once expelled from the origin universe, the book will maintain a vector that'll change to land into a nearby universe that holds close enough to its identity. Once landed, the origin universe can establish an easier link with the new universe through that anchor and create a more permanent link. 
                      </p>
                      <br/>
                      <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>Thus, as the Empire began rebuilding, it inherited a project from the remnants of the Equestrian governments regarding interuniversal travel based on the writings of an old unicorn wizard. Deciding that this was a worthwhile project, the Empire chose to start pursuing it in earnest. Perhaps, a new world could be found. With its new wonders and so, that the Empire could in a way, repent for the horrors they've committed. 
                      </p>
                      <br/>
                      <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>Instead, they found an Equestria on the brink of war and collapsing into war as their own world as. Parasitic and inefficient aristocrats choking out the principality, as claimed by a stallion that was exiled and whom they first discovered. <strong><Link href="/char/preventus-i-eye" className="link-color-unique"><span>Preventus I Eye</span></Link></strong>. Adopted quickly into the Imperial Family, the Kaisar directed the Empire for an encroaching upon this world to bring about their ideals of Harmony they've managed to forged out of war. Drawing in the states of <strong><Link href="/nation/snowlandia" className="link-color-unique"><span>Snowlandia</span></Link></strong> and <strong><Link href="/nation/calavaria" className="link-color-unique"><span>Calavaria</span></Link></strong> into their sphere, the Empire moved to topple the corrupt regime and sought to bring about Democracy to the region. A coup, a civil war, and arms being shipped into <strong><Link href="/planet/equus-2" className="link-color-unique"><span>Equestria-2</span></Link></strong> allowed for the Empire to claim for themselves a new democratic protectorcate in the new world under the reign of the aforementioned Preventus. But unbeknownst to the Empire and Her new found allies, the old rulers of Canterlot, <strong><Link href="/char/the-deciever" className="link-color-unique"><span>the Deciever</span></Link></strong>, ran off along with the rest of her deviled possy into other worlds to convince other Equestrias to launch a crusade back against the Empire.
                      </p>
                      <br/>
                      <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>An alliance of states were gathered up by the Deciever, and declaring the birth of the <strong><Link href="/nation/restorationist-equestrian-coalition" className="link-color-unique"><span>Restorationist Equestrian Coalition</span></Link></strong>, they opened up portals once more on the eastside of the newly founded state of <strong><Link href="/nation/mleocun" className="link-color-unique"><span>Mleocun</span></Link></strong> to take back their deceitful rule. The Empire battled with the Coalition. The Empire, a child of war, fostering along itself several younger nations with it as they picked up the sword once more to advance against their enemies, horrid autocrats and corrupt rulers. The Coalition, steadied itself as they prepared themselves for a righteous reclaimation and liberation of their old world. Both sides, did not knew of just how bad the war was going to become as by the second year, a stalemate occured on the center mountain ridges of Mleocun and the fighting grew bitter and regressed.</p>
                      <br/>
                      <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>The old nature of trench warfare slowly creeped back in. A novelty to the numerically superior Coalition and an ancient horror for the technologically ascendent Empire. Both sides saw themselves spiral into a feast of barbarism in the battles of the Mideast of Mleocun. With trench lines scattered up and down the Mareisisipi river, and often mountains serving as just but another type of land to dig trenches in. Each side saw themselves trading lives for inches of trenches that may with ease be retaken by the enemy for an equivalent magnitude of lives. A horror which saw notable rivers clogged up with bodies. </p>
                      <br/>
                      <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>And when stagnation set in by the third year of fighting, desperation creeped its ugly head over the horizon to both sides as it increasingly became clear that the war will not end easily. Trench raids grew increasingly common, as so was the deployment of mustard gas as the Empire rolled out old tactics to break Coalition Lines. The Coalition responded by increasingly growing dependent on magically enhanced soldiers for desperate breakthroughs, and using spells to cast foul curses on Imperial troops. The Empire responded in kind with continued development of bioweapons and incidenary weapons. Incinerating all those that survived plagues and horrific monstrosities. But like all ladders, there was another rung to climb. And another. First came spells, then <strong><Link href="/concept/memetics" className="link-color-unique"><span>Memetics</span></Link></strong>, then plaguebombs, then antimemetic viruses, then virulent pathogens. The trench battles slowly lost any sense of limitation to trenches. With powerful weapons, hundreds of kilometres of trenches could be lost in a day due to a particularly effective self replicating memetic attack driving all soldiers within it insane, or a particularly dastardly bioweapon simply murdering them all. Cities were levelled as gunfire traded fire with screeching noises of hell, virulent disease, and constant bombing. But yet, this was all still relatively limited to Mleocun. The main field of battle.</p>
                      <br/>
                      <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>The war kept going on, first a decade, then another, then a third more, then a century. By this point, the MineLegoEquestrians and arcane defectors from the Coalition had begun developing early motic-based genetic engineering, to try and stave off extinction from a weapon that both sides knew they both had. Nuclear weapons.</p>
                      <br/>
                      <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>Unlike all the weapons of war they've deployed, nuclear weapons could verily easily be deployed and attempt to be delivered cross universes. Memetics required sapient vectors, which by now had been particularly exhausted by either genetic upgrades, arcane shielding, or simple raw survival making them unviable. Biological warfare became harder to use as troops grew more knowledgable in how to stop such spreads, using their masks and combat suits as second skins. Everything was slowly being countered, but nuclear weapons. </p>
                      <br/>
                      <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>Both sides can't really stop nuclear weapons, more of the effect that both sides had no possible idea how one would utilize them effectively and prevent a second strike from the enemy. But the thought of escalating the ladder became more and more of a thought for the Coalition as the Empire slowly took ground. Mechanised warfare had rolled back in after multiple failed attempts, and the lines were drawn near the East Coast. With the centre of operations Manehatten on the line for collapse. The call was made.</p>

                  <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>Approxmiately 330 million Imperials, including allies, and approximately 3.6 billion Coalition citizens perished in the Thermonuclear exchange. The Empire, shouldering the thermonuclear exchange better thanks to being able to shoot down a portion of the missiles launching the payloads. The same was similar for the Coalition, but they underestimated the total number of missiles that would be fired from the Empire's side. Obliterating more cities than they ever could across their coalition. 
                  </p>
                  <br/>
                  <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>With most of their enemy in ruin, the Empire moved on, unopposed with what remained of their allies as well to properly end the war. Repeating the procedures they made that brough them into Equestria-2 in the first place, they moved on to deal with remains of the Coalition. Anger striking out of their sword against an enemy who dared invade them. The Empire managed to ease with steamroll the remains of the Coalition, folding colonies and protectorcates out of the remnants... 
                  </p>
                  <br/>
                  <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>It would be an understatement to say that the Great Multiversal War was both great and a near present idea within the Empire's mythos. One does not remove such a scarring and jarring incident away from a nation's collective consciousness easily, and for the remainder of the Empire's populations and its allies the scars of the war ran deep enough to become the foundational myth for their states after the war. And the war, would define the way the nations of the Multiversal Empire interacted in the future and how they saw themselves... </p>

            <h3 className="d-inline-block mb-2" style={{"text-decoration":"underline;"}}><b>Overview</b></h3>
            <div className="col-xl-12">
              <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>Amassing across 156340000 square kilometres on its Homeworld of <strong><a href="../pages/404page.html " className="link-color-unique"><span>Equus-001AB</span></a></strong>, the Empire is a large place. Burgeoning with a native population now recorded to be in the rough nine point seveteen (9.17) billions, the Empire - or as it is more commonly referred to as the 'Home Empire' - has no shortage of citizens. Streching from the soft mountain peaks of the western Xinmareland, to the bountiful and fish rich Hippogriffian Archipelago, there are Imperial Citizens there, living their lives as best they could under the gentle and auspicious glare of the bureaucratic regime. The governmental system of the Empire, is best described as their people are. Insane, crack addicted, actually innovative, butthurt, and just a wee bit psychotic. This, could be argued, might be an effect of having such a vibrant populace, but at the same time, when about 94.3% of the populace has at one point in their life been a bureaucrat, it makes you wonder if its the other way around and the development of state institutions in this way caused the 'vibrancy' of the people.
              </p>
              <br/>
              <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>But one has to consider that, how institutional development plays a role within the development of a culture, and vice versa. And this is a general fact that has to be kept in mind. The Empire as a sociopolitical entity, has most of its traits derived from the philosophical consequences of their most important figure being a political shut in, whilst at the same time being a contradictory mess of idiosyncaries masquearading the general form of a sapient being whilst being the ruler during the most important formative years of the state. These idiosyncaries, for better or worse, translate to a socio economic development along cultural lines of bureaucratic ascendency and a strong tradition of second guessing and stopping said second guessing by utilizing the foundational corner stones of modern nation-states and civilizations, writing. 
              </p>
              <br/>
              <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>The nation-state of MineLegotia and Equestria had evolved mainly to cater to the interests of bureaucratic and civilizational interests. The former to ensure that the state on its own could function well and supercede any issues that came from mortal rulers, and the latter to ensure that the nation could survive past any catastrophe with knowledge of their shared culutral and socio-lingual heritage. Directed by this, the nation-state could be seen as an organism moving to secure itself and ensure that it can continue living as an entity. With good coordination between the state's sturcture and the noosphere surroudning the concept of the nation, the state could realize its imagined community, and allowing the nation-state as a concept to ascend from the level of a imagined community to that of a entity-concept, which would in practice, often outlast particular imagined communities. The easiest way to contextualise this is to imagine the difference between the relation that ancient Rome has with modern Italy, and the relation that the Tang Dynasty has with Modern China. Italy as a concept can demonstrate a link that it has with ancient Rome, but it cannot properly demonstrate nor does it want to declare it to be Rome itself, but instead a distant descendant of it. The concept of the Roman nation was discarded in favor of the concept of the Italian nation instead. Contrast that modern China, on a whole attempts to convince its people that it is a direct continuation of ancient Chinese Dynasties such as the Tang. Declaring that this is merely the modern incarnation of the Chinese nation. This, is the situation for the noosphere regarding the concept of the nation-state of MineLegotia and Equestria, due to a heavy emphasis on the focus of preventing confusion by creating additional records, there isn't nary a doubt regarding the connection of the modern to the initial nation-state. </p>
              <br/>
              <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>With this conceptual structure, it can with ease make clear the nature of the Empire. The Kaisar's vision for a state which he could make a state that he could rule as according to his idiosyncaries, had resulted into a state suited well for the preservation of culture at a level much advanced and common compared to most other nations. Due to the fact that the one that ensured that the state could preserve their culture, and often through the actions of bureaucrats adapting the idiosyncaries of the Kaisar, the bureacurats would adapt into taking a role which saw them elavated sociologically. With this, the state ends up creating an environment in which sociological and cultural data survives at a rate much more significant than most other socities, allowing for a more cohesive societal structure in comparison to them.</p>
              <br/>
              <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>Societally, this has resulted in a much closer trust towards the government which allows for the state to exercise much more ease in managing the society. Of course, such closeness opens up for more dangerous exploitations of such trust, and has resulted in a more active society after the first dozen or so high level corruption cases. But nonetheless, the resulting structure could be argued to be similar to that of a 'Whig Government'. This type of government may be seen as relatively unstable and undesirable by some, but it is one that is mostly accepted by the people of the nation. After all they were all just but mortals, all except for the Lipas. The Lipas function in the state as a temporary tool in terms of time longer than the average lifespan. Due to the fear and rationale that the original social contract could potentially be manipulated over the years as people forget the idealistic foundation of their nation, the Lipas were roped in in order to maintain that social contract until a day where all could live as long as them. But this leads to the same situation of normal politicians with the Lipas being treated as any other politicians. Despite so, they can be affored some suspicison due to their unique role. The long term preservation of the nation-state's concepts.</p>
              <br />
              <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>Due to this, the mortal politicians have resulted in focusing on internal and domestic issues that concern the nation-state such as the healthcare services, industrial regulations, and roadside tollbooths. Whilst the Lipas focused on long term foreign policy, socio-political development, and long term national survival. All in all, a good deal for all parties. </p>
              <br />
              <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>Thus the nation of MineLegotia and Equestria, ends up with three core parties, interacting with one another. The Lipas, the State, and the People. The Lipas and the People could pressure the State into proper action and remembering who they should be serving and what they should be doing. The State and the people could pressure the Lipas into action to assist in times of crises and remind them of who they are supposed to be protecting. The Lipas and State could cooperate in order to utilize the people properly as the most basic resource of any society. </p>
              <br/>
              <p className="card-text mb-auto" style={{"text-align":"justify;"}}>It is a system that worked, works, and will work as long as the Empire stands. </p>
